# Sample data

Here I have a couple quick scripts for visualizing and classification of data based upon the pre-computed SPL logs in sub-directories. Note, I didn't include the raw PCAP for _web-browse_ because it included traffic from my personal devices, and I don't want to accidentally disclose something private.
